-Pascal's triangle can be formed using dynamic rpogrammming.
 for n>c the value will be 0.
 rest elements can be formed using:
 elemnt[n][c]=arr[n][c]=arr[n-1][c-1]+arr[n-1][c];
-memory in dynamic programming is =n*k where n is the size of array and k is the data type;
Kadle's algorithm
-Kadale's Algorithm works only if there is a mixture of both positive and negative elements.
