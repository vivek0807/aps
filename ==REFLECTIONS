==REFLECTIONS==
BITWISE:
1. >> operator right shifts the bits. Doing right shift is equivalent to dividing the operand number by 2^n bits.
   << operaor left shifts the bits. Equivalent to multiplying the number by 2^n

-Pascal's triangle can be formed using dynamic rpogrammming.
 for n>c the value will be 0.
 rest elements can be formed using:
 elemnt[n][c]=arr[n][c]=arr[n-1][c-1]+arr[n-1][c];
-memory in dynamic programming is =n*k where n is the size of array and k is the data type;
Kadle's algorithm
-Kadale's Algorithm works only if there is a mixture of both positive and negative elements.

=>dynamic programming using 2D array:
   -algorithming storage of values in array
   -one time computation and multiple aplication
   -Can Also have application for recurssion.
--- Recursive Approach uses more memory.
==>Look Up Table:
   Can be used to store calaculated values as for faster searching.
   Efficiency:
   fetch O(1),Time O(N^2) and space O(N^2).
   Is generally a 1-D array
   
==>Square root decomposition:
   --It is a query optimization technique that reduces time complexity by a factor of sqrt(n)
   --reduces the main array at the size of sqrt(n)
   --query efficency O(n)
   --Time & space efficiency are  O(N)
   
==> Skip List:
   --A linked list based data structure that is used to process query.
   -- It is hierachy based linked list and each layer acts as express lane for the below layer
   -contains log1/p n lists
   -insert nd fetch efficiency O(N)
   -space O(n log n)
   
==> Segmentation Tree:
   --Basically a binary tree
   --Generally used for calcluating the sum within a range of a given array
      each node represernt a sum within a range
   --Query takes O(1) coplexity
   --Update takes O(n) complexity
